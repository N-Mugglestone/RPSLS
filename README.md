This project is a full stack project that I am desiging as a proof of concept. 

:small_blue_diamond: What can I put together, what can't I? &nbsp;

:small_blue_diamond: What problems can have five solutions and which ones cause the least amount of problems down the line. 

:small_blue_diamond: I want to experiment and constantly improve this project, to such a degree that whilst the user stories will be complete, this never will be. 

:diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: With programming ever changing this project will always be under construction, always improving and always advancing just as I am going to be.
